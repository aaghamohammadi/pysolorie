How can one maximize the solar irradiation energy received by a solar panel?


## Features

``pysolorie`` is a library designed to help you find this optimal orientation. Its features include, but are not limited to:

- Finding the optimal orientation for a fixed solar panel, assuming a clear-sky model.
- Plotting the optimal orientation over a range of days.
- Plotting the total direct irradiation over a range of days.
- Generating a CSV report detailing the optimal orientation over a range of days.
- Calculating the sunrise and sunset hour angles for a specific day.
- Utilizing Hottelâ€™s Model to estimate the transmittance of clear-sky beam radiation.
- Calculating the solar zenith angle.
- Calculating the solar time.
- Calculating solar declination and hour angle.
