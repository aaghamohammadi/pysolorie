pysolorie: Orientation Analysis of Solar Panel
==============================================


Introduction
============

How can one find the optimal orientation of a solar panel to maximize the total energy received from the sun?

``pysolorie`` is a library designed to help you find this optimal orientation. Its features include, but are not limited to:

- Finding the optimal orientation for a fixed solar panel under the assumption of a clear-sky model.
- Plotting the Optimal Orientation for a range of days.
- Generating a CSV Report of the optimal orientation for a range of days.
- Calculating the sunrise and sunset hour angles for a given day.
- Utilizing the Hottel Model to estimate clear-sky beam radiation transmittance.
- Calculating the zenith angle.
- Calculating the solar time.
- Calculating Solar Declination and Hour Angle.
