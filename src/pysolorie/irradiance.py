    def calculate_extraterrestrial_irradiance(self, day_of_year: int) -> float:
        r"""
        Calculate the extraterrestrial solar irradiance for a given day of the year.

        The extraterrestrial solar irradiance, :math:`I`,
        is the annual average of the Sun's irradiation intensity.
        This refers to the amount of solar energy received per unit
        area per unit time on a surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays,
        outside Earth's atmosphere.

        The formula used is:

        .. math::
            I = SC
            \times (1 + 0.033 \times \cos (\frac{2\pi~n}{365}))


        | - :math:`SC` is the average solar radiation arriving outside
           of the Earth's atmosphere,
           which is approximately ``1367`` Megawatts per square meter [1]_.
           This is also known as the solar constant.
        | - The factor ``0.033``, which is two times the eccentricity of
            the Earth's orbit around the Sun, accounts for the variation
            in the Earth-Sun distance due to the Earth's elliptical orbit.
        | - :math:`n` is the day of the year (i.e., ``day_of_year``)

        :param day\_of\_year: The day of the year, ranging from 1 to 365.
        :type day\_of\_year: int

        :return: The extraterrestrial solar irradiance in Megawatts per square meter.
        :rtype: float
